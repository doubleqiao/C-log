# C++-log
Knowledge learned during learning C++

- 1.The comment about /* and */ actually find the nearest */ to end the comment. Not matter the */ is in a double quatation or not.
For example: 
/ *  " * / " /
will actually be
"/

- 2.The "i" in the “for” loop is only valid inside the for loop.

- 3.Sometimes the compilation failed and there is no errors in the source file, maybe it is because some symbols are under the Chinese input state. -_-||

-4.Small mistakes matter! Pay attention to the sequence of the input arguments of the function.
